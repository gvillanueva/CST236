ISSUE Number:   002
BRIEF:          pyTona throws exception when input is not a string

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a pyTona.main.Interface object.
2. Call the object's ask method with 1234 as the question param.

Comments:
According to the code, since the input is not a string, an exception is thrown. However, this behavior is not by any of
the requirements.
