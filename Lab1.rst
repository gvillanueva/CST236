Lab 1 Write-up 
==============

1. What was the hardest part of this lab?

The hardest part of this lab for me was getting failed tests to abort a commit.  I strong-armed a few possibilities and had to undo a few test commits before I got it working.  I was trying to find “FAILED” within stdout, but it turned out it was actually in stderr.  It took me a while before I thought of possibility.

2. During the course of this lab, why did we exclude .pyc files?

We exclude .pyc files because they are binary files, and binary files cause problems for git repositories.

3. Name three files which would likely need to have a gitignore added?

Three other files which would likely need a .gitignore line are object files (.o), file-based databases like SQLite (.db), and libraries (.lib/.dll)

4. What is a pyunit TestCase?

A TestCase is a class that inherits from the pyunit TestCase base class.  It groups test steps which test units of the source code.  A successful test provide the expected output for a given input(s).  In order for a test step to be run automatically, it needs to be a function with a name starting with "test``_``".

5. What is the difference between a git cherry pick and a rebase?

A rebase operation replays all changes from a branch into its upstream, and it changes the branch base to the tip of the upstream.  This makes it appear as though all work occurred on the same branch.  A cherry pick merges one or more change(s) from a branch and does not affect the source branch’s history.

6. How could you use git to output just the author name of a given file for the current version of the repo?

git log --format=format:%an -- <filename>

7. During this lab did you explore Tortoise Git or GIT Extensions? If not take a look at them, they probably would be useful for the remainder of the class.

I have not explored them yet.  For the lab I used git within bash on Chrubuntu.

8. Did you find the second issue in get_triangle_type? Did you choose to test the code as is or fix the code in get_triangle_type.

I did find the second issue in get_triangle_type.  I chose to fix the code in get_triangle type since its original form did not reflect the apparent intent of a, based on the len(a) == 3 conditional.
