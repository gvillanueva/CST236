ISSUE Number:   004
BRIEF:          Requirement #0006 not specific enough

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a pyTona.main.Interface object.
2. Call the object's ask method with "Why don't you understand>" as the question param.

Comments:
According to requirement #0006, a question's keywords must match a known question with a minimum of 90% matching. I
tested this using 4/5 words (80%) from initial question #4.  However, it could also be interpreted that matching occurs
on the *character* level, and not the keyword level.  In that case, I would have 24/27 characters matching (20/23 not
including spaces).  In this case, we have well over 90% matching.
