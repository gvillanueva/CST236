1. What are five examples of other testing(nose2) plugins that might be useful?

2. Do you plan to create any of these plugins for your term project?

3. What is the hardest part of this lab?
The requirements took a while to test, but the

4. Did the code fully and completely implement the requirements? Explain
The code had some mistakes in it, but for the most part it implemented the requirements.

5. Was the requirements complete? Explain
The requirements were fairly complete, but they were not thorough.  There is some ambiguity in the requirements.  For
instance, #0006 states that "The system shall determine an answer to a question as a correct if the keywords provide a
90% match and return the answer".  However, my initial test was to treat each keyword as a unit of that test.  That is,
is the question has 5 keywords, and 4 out of 5 match, then the matching is 80% and fails.  It appears as though the
implementation of this matches on a smaller unit, however; possibly on a per-character basis.
