ISSUE Number:   008
BRIEF:          Initial question #2 always returns 42 seconds

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a pyTona.main.Interface object.
2. Call the object's ask method passing 'How many seconds since 12>' for the question param.

Comments:
OUTCOME: 42 seconds.
EXPECTED: 17472 when the time of day is 4:51ish.

The requirements also don't explicitly state that the answer shall have 'seconds' appended to it. This would be similar
to requirement #0017.
