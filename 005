ISSUE Number:   005
BRIEF:          Initial answer 1 not appending "miles" to return value

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a pyTona.main.Interface object.
2. Call the object's ask method with "What is 1284.5 feet in miles>" as the question param.

Comments:
According to requirement #0017, "miles" should be appended to the end of the return. It wasn't.

EXPECTED: "0.243276515152miles"
